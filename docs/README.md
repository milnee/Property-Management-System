# 🏠 Property Management System

A comprehensive **JavaFX-based Property Management System**, created with the assistance of **AI tools** to demonstrate full-stack application design and development.  

This project is designed for **property owners and managers** who need an easy way to manage their properties, tenants, rent payments, maintenance requests, and communication — all in one place.

This system allows users to:
- Manage multiple properties  
- Track tenants and lease details  
- Monitor rent payments and expenses  
- Handle maintenance requests efficiently  
- Send automated email notifications  
- Generate financial and operational reports
